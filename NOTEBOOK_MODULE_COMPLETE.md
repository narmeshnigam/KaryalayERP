## 🔧 How to Test

### 1. Create a Note
1. Navigate to Notebook
2. Click "➕ Create Note"
3. Enter title: "Test Note"
4. Add content in rich-text editor
5. Add tags: "test, documentation"
6. Upload a PDF file
7. Set share scope: Private
8. Click "Create Note"

### 2. View the Note
- Should show formatted content
- Attachment should be downloadable
- Version should show as v1
- Tags should be clickable

### 3. Test Permissions
- Create note as Admin
- Set share scope to "Organization"
- Login as Employee
- Should be able to view but not edit

### 4. Test Search
- Go to main listing
- Search for "test"
- Should find the note
- Click tag to filter by tag

## 🎨 UI Consistency

All pages use existing ERP styling:
- Brand colors (#003581 for primary actions)
- Card-based layouts
- Consistent button styles
- Icon-based navigation
- Responsive grid system
- Hover effects on cards

## 🔐 Security Features

✅ SQL injection protection (prepared statements)
✅ XSS prevention (htmlspecialchars on all output)
✅ File upload validation (type, size)
✅ Permission checks on every action
✅ CSRF protection (session-based)
✅ Access control on view/edit/delete
✅ Sanitized file paths

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- Indexes on frequently queried columns
- LEFT JOINs for optional data
- Pagination ready (can be added to index.php)
- Efficient permission checking
- Cascade deletes for data integrity

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Run setup script** to create tables
2. **Add permissions** in Roles module
3. **Test basic flow**: Create → View → Edit → Delete
4. **Create remaining files** (edit.php is most important)
5. **Add module icon** in `/assets/icons/` directory
6. **Test with different user roles**

## 💡 Tips for Extending

### Add Export to PDF
```php
require_once 'path/to/dompdf/autoload.inc.php';
use Dompdf\Dompdf;

$dompdf = new Dompdf();
$dompdf->loadHtml($note['content']);
$dompdf->render();
$dompdf->stream("note_{$note_id}.pdf");
```

### Add Email Notification on Share
```php
// In share_note function
$to = $user['email'];
$subject = "Note shared with you: " . $note['title'];
$message = "A note has been shared with you...";
mail($to, $subject, $message);
```

### Add Markdown Support
```php
require_once 'path/to/Parsedown.php';
$Parsedown = new Parsedown();
$html = $Parsedown->text($markdown_content);
```

## 📞 Support

1. Check README.md in `/public/notebook/`
2. Review error logs in PHP
