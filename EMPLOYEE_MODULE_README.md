- **Solution**: System auto-generates with timestamp fallback

**Issue**: File upload not working
- **Solution**: Check uploads/ folder permissions (777)
- Verify max_upload_filesize in php.ini

**Issue**: Search not returning results
- **Solution**: Check search syntax, use partial matches

**Issue**: Gross salary not calculating
- **Solution**: Check JavaScript console, verify field names
