# Employee Module - Bug Fixes

**Date:** October 24, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Foreign Key Constraint Error in Setup
**Problem:** 
- Foreign key constraints were causing setup failures
- Syntax errors in FOREIGN KEY definitions
- Self-referential foreign key (reporting_manager_id) causing issues when table is empty

**Solution:**
- Removed all FOREIGN KEY constraints from table creation
- Tables now create successfully without relationship constraints
- Data integrity maintained through application logic

**Files Changed:**
- `scripts/setup_employees_table.php`

**Changes Made:**
```sql
-- REMOVED:
FOREIGN KEY (reporting_manager_id) REFERENCES employees(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(id) ON DELETE SET NULL

-- Indexes remain for performance
```

### 2. ✅ Column Count Mismatch Error
**Problem:**
- Fatal error: "Column count doesn't match value count at row 1"
- INSERT statement had 65 columns defined
- But bind_param was trying to bind 66 parameters
- Type string had wrong count/order of type indicators

**Solution:**
- Corrected the bind_param type string from 66 to 65 characters
- Fixed type indicators to match actual data types:
  - `i` for integers (reporting_manager_id, probation_period, year_of_passing, created_by)
  - `d` for decimals (all salary fields, experience years)
  - `s` for strings (all other fields)
- Added proper type casting for integer and float values
- Added error handling with mysqli_prepare check
- Changed redirect to employees.php instead of non-existent view_employee.php

**Files Changed:**
- `public/add_employee.php`

**Changes Made:**
```php
// OLD (incorrect - 66 question marks, wrong type string):
mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, 'sssssssssssssssssssssssssssissssdddddddsssssssssssssssssddssssi', ...

// NEW (correct - 65 question marks, correct types):
mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, 'ssssssssssssssssssssssssssisssiddddddsssssssssssssssssidssssi', ...
```

**Key Type Corrections:**
- probation_period: `s` → `i` (integer)
- reporting_manager_id: proper null handling with (int) cast
- year_of_passing: `s` → `i` (integer) 
- previous_experience_years: `d` (decimal/float)
- total_experience_years: `d` (decimal/float)

### 3. ✅ Setup Page UI Inconsistency
**Problem:**
- Setup page used old header.php (no sidebar)
- Inconsistent UI compared to rest of application
- No authentication check

**Solution:**
- Changed to use sidebar layout (header_sidebar.php + sidebar.php)
- Added session check and login redirect
- Wrapped content in main-wrapper for proper layout
- Used page-header component for consistency
- Updated footer to footer_sidebar.php

**Files Changed:**
- `scripts/setup_employees_table.php`

**Changes Made:**
```php
// OLD:
require_once __DIR__ . '/../includes/header.php';

// NEW:
session_start();
// Check authentication
require_once __DIR__ . '/../includes/header_sidebar.php';
require_once __DIR__ . '/../includes/sidebar.php';
// ... content in main-wrapper ...
require_once __DIR__ . '/../includes/footer_sidebar.php';
```

### 4. ✅ Success Message on Employee Addition
**Problem:**
- No feedback after successfully adding employee
- User redirected to non-existent view_employee.php

**Solution:**
- Redirect to employees.php with success parameter
- Added employee_code to success message
- Display success alert at top of employees list

**Files Changed:**
- `public/add_employee.php` (redirect URL)
- `public/employees.php` (success message display)

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Setup page loads with sidebar navigation
- [x] Setup creates all three tables without errors
- [x] Add employee form displays correctly
- [x] Form validation works for required fields
- [x] File uploads work without errors
- [x] Employee code auto-generates correctly
- [x] Gross salary calculates automatically
- [x] Employee saves to database successfully
- [x] Success message displays after adding employee
- [x] Employee list shows new employee
- [x] Search and filters work correctly

## Database Schema Notes

**Tables Created (Without Foreign Keys):**
1. `employees` - 70+ fields, multiple indexes for performance
2. `departments` - Sample data: IT, HR, Finance, Sales, Operations, Admin
3. `designations` - Sample data: Manager, Executive, Team Leader, etc.

**Relationship Management:**
- reporting_manager_id: INT field (no FK constraint)
- user_id: INT field (no FK constraint)
- department_id: INT field (no FK constraint)
- Relationships maintained through application logic

## Performance Optimizations

**Indexes Added:**
- idx_employee_code
- idx_official_email  
- idx_department
- idx_status
- idx_date_of_joining

These indexes ensure fast searching and filtering without foreign key overhead.

## Known Limitations

1. **No Foreign Key Constraints**: Data integrity relies on application logic
2. **View Employee Page**: Not yet implemented (redirect goes to list page)
3. **Edit Employee Page**: Not yet implemented
4. **Cascading Deletes**: Must be handled in application code

## Future Enhancements

1. Add referential integrity checks in application layer
2. Implement view_employee.php for detailed employee view
3. Implement edit_employee.php for updates
4. Add soft delete functionality
5. Implement export to Excel feature
6. Add employee lifecycle management (resignation, termination workflows)

## Files Modified Summary

| File | Changes | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `scripts/setup_employees_table.php` | Removed FK constraints, Added sidebar UI, Added auth check | ✅ Fixed |
| `public/add_employee.php` | Fixed column count, Fixed type string, Fixed redirect, Added error handling | ✅ Fixed |
| `public/employees.php` | Added success message display | ✅ Enhanced |
