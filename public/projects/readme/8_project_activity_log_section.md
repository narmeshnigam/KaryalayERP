## üßÆ 4) Database Reference
Refers to `project_activity_log` from the Projects DB Document.

| Field | Type | Description |
|--------|------|--------------|
| id | INT, PK, AI | Unique log entry ID |
| project_id | INT, FK | Linked project |
| user_id | INT, FK | User performing the action |
| activity_type | ENUM('Task','Phase','Document','Status','Member','General') | Type of event |
| reference_id | INT NULL | Related entity ID |
| description | TEXT | Summary of what occurred |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | Timestamp of the action |

Additional considerations:
- All project submodules trigger entries upon data mutation.
