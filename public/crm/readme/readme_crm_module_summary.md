### üîó Module Connectivity
The CRM sections are interdependent and operate around a **lead-centric follow-up model**. Each section supports both standalone use and relational integration.

| Source Module | Linked Modules | Relationship Type | Description |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Leads** | Calls, Meetings, Visits, Tasks | One-to-Many | Each lead can generate multiple follow-up activities. |
| **Calls** | Leads, Meetings, Tasks | Many-to-One / Optional | Calls may result in scheduling a meeting or task. |
| **Meetings** | Leads, Visits, Tasks | Many-to-One / Optional | Meetings may lead to field visits or post-meeting tasks. |
| **Visits** | Leads, Tasks | Many-to-One / Optional | Field visits can produce follow-up tasks or notes. |
| **Tasks** | Leads, Calls, Meetings, Visits | Many-to-One / Optional | Tasks close the action loop for activities originating from any module. |

Each activity (Call, Meeting, Visit, Task) updates the **lead‚Äôs last_contacted_at** field for real-time insight into communication history.

### üìÖ Calendar Integration
The CRM Calendar provides a unified timeline of all scheduled and completed activities. It helps users plan daily actions and view upcoming or overdue engagements.

| Activity Type | Calendar Color | Description |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Lead Follow-up** | Purple | Next scheduled interaction with a lead |
| **Call** | Orange | Scheduled or completed telephonic activity |
| **Meeting** | Green | In-person or online discussion |
| **Visit** | Teal | Field meeting or on-site interaction |
| **Task** | Blue | Assigned or completed operational task |

Each event is clickable, opening detailed records and linked entities. Follow-up events auto-populate the calendar upon creation.
