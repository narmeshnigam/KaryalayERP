### üîç Purpose
This document defines all database tables under the CRM module of **Karyalay ERP ‚Äì Phase 1**, now updated with a **lead-centric follow-up model**. The design ensures easy scalability and logical consistency across all CRM entities: Leads, Calls, Meetings, Visits, and Tasks.

Each table supports SME-oriented features such as simplified follow-up scheduling, multi-item product/service interests, and relationship mapping between activities and leads.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Foreign Key References

| `created_by`, `assigned_to`, `closed_by` | `employees.id` | Employee relation mapping |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Flow Example
**1. Lead Creation:** `crm_leads` record created ‚Üí may include `follow_up_date` and `follow_up_type`.
**2. Auto-Scheduler:** On reaching `follow_up_date`, a new entry is created in one of the activity tables based on `follow_up_type`.
**3. Activity Logging:** Every new Call, Meeting, Visit, or Task updates `last_contacted_at` in the linked lead.
**4. Conversion:** When status = 'Converted', all pending follow-ups are ignored.

---

## üìà Standardization Notes
- All date/time fields use MySQL standard `DATETIME` (UTC timezone)
- Attachments stored as relative paths in `/uploads/crm/`
- `status` ENUMs are configurable per module from admin settings
- Lead follow-up logic is central; activity follow-ups are optional extensions

This schema provides the foundation for a **lead-driven CRM flow** within Karyalay ERP ‚Äî lightweight, relationally consistent, and ready for expansion into client and project management in Phase 2.
