## üß≠ 4. Lead Lifecycle Flow

### Step 1 ‚Äì Creation
- A lead is added with required details and optional product/service interests.
- Assigned to an employee for handling.

### Step 2 ‚Äì Engagement
- The employee performs activities (calls, meetings, visits, or tasks) linked to the lead.
- The system updates `last_contacted_at` automatically on each new related activity.

### Step 3 ‚Äì Follow-Up Management
- User may set a follow-up date and type.
- When the follow-up date arrives, the system auto-creates a corresponding CRM entry (based on follow-up type) and places it in the shared calendar.

### Step 4 ‚Äì Conversion or Closure
- Once the lead is marked as **Converted**, all pending follow-ups are ignored.
- Dropped leads are retained for record but excluded from reminders.
